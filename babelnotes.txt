# Babelbot should remain independant and be able to be shut off after x amount of books.
#Babelbot changes: 
##more spacing randomness
##more randomness everywhere
##
##
##

# Searchbot should use better algorithem to hog less cpu (new dictionary?)
#Searchbot changes: 
##make parallel children searchbot (read x pages at a time) processes spawn from one parent
##create variable at page start then move that value to new page once the page is done
##

Old babel process: 
Create single book
Search each page one after another, ranking each one
Scan all page ranking and assign a ranking to whole book
Delete book if ranking is below the threshold


New babel process:
Create x book(s)
- parallel the processes if this is more then one
- 
Create 5 searchbot processes (per book?):
- 410 pages, 82 pages each
- 
Judge the books:
- can probably be replaced by a bashscript, or the babel script itself
- 


#Bigbab: Recreate to properly compare LF to rand (page by page?)

#inquisitor: page by page burn til complete book
